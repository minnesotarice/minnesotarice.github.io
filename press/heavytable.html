          A new blog uses keen writing and gorgeous illustration to document Asian restaurants
  			</h4>

        <h5 class="press-author">
          By James Norton
        </h5>

        <p>
          With few exceptions, the recent trend with online storytelling has been to pivot to video and provide less of everything else - less original content, less trenchant criticism, and less documentary context.
        </p>

        <p>
          In that regard, the newly established Minnesota Rice blog is a fantastic throwback - its writing is thoughtful, its watercolor illustrations and photographs are documentary (and frequently gorgeous) and its ability to immerse readers in the totality of a restaurant is formidable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Paulina Hoong and Sandy Lor have been friends for nearly a decade, originally meeting at Carleton College. The two joined creative forces on Minnesota Rice, bringing Hoong's watercolor illustration with Lor's photography to bear on a diverse cross section of Asian restaurants in Minnesota. The two friends co-write the site, sharing a Google document in real time. The website has documented seven spots so far, and its most recent post (Quang in Minneapolis) was published on Wednesday.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's their description of Lechon Paksiw at Manilla Sizzling Wok and Grill - note the depth of detail, the cultural context, and the biographical context that gives it a tremendous sense of richness:
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>The lechon sauce consisted of mixed liver spread, consisting of vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. When the lechon paksiw hit our stomach, it felt filling and just right. The dish is heavy, but it reminded Paulina heavily of a similar Cantonese braised pork dish she ate growing up, only lechon paksiw was a little sweeter. Sandy was also reminded of Hmong sweet pork, but the Hmong version is even sweeter with a thinner sweet soy sauce.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Sandy particularly enjoyed it, as it reminded her of the food that Hmong people eat at large gatherings, which she hasn’t had in awhile because of COVID-19. It’s interesting that all three of these cultures - Filipino, Hmong, and Chinese - have a similar braised pork belly, while American culture doesn’t have a similar dish.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HEAVY TABLE:</b> What was the inspiration or incident that led you two to found Minnesota Rice?
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>PAULINA HOONG:</b> In March 2020, Coronavirus hit our country and because of the hateful rhetoric of President Trump there was a big surge in anti-Asian sentiment. We noticed that Asian restaurants were struggling.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HEAVY TABLE:</b> And you have a particularly close connection to that community, right?
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HOONG:</b> First hand - my parents own a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bechinarestaurant/" target="_blank"><b>restaurant</b></a> in Blue Earth, Minnesota. They had to completely restructure their business to [pivot to] takeout, and at the same time they were facing a lot of hateful slurs from their own customers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We saw a lot of these businesses start to go out of business, so we wanted to start a project to uplift Asian businesses in the Twin Cities and we wanted to feature all regions from East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia to make sure all Asian restaurants are uplifted.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HEAVY TABLE:</b> What's your process for researching and publishing?
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>SANDY LOR:</b> We created a website at minnesotarice.com and we have an Instagram handle at minnesota.rice. So we go into a restaurant, and do our best to pick the most authentic cuisine from the region. We'll ask our friends, and look up what the most traditional might be ... then we write in-depth posts featuring each dish we tried, what we liked about it, what we didn't like about it, how the flavors enticed the spirits around us... and what we like to do is also take pictures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of COVID-19 we weren't comfortable eating in the [restaurants] so we take pictures of what the food looks like when we get it our takeout bins, and we also plate it to the best of our ability and take photos to make it look nice.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HEAVY TABLE:</b> The "authentic" is pretty slippery, and we're always struggling to define it and understand it - how do you guys process its meaning?
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HOONG:</b> Since my parents own a Chinese restaurant, during the day we serve American Chinese food - my parents did not want to eat the food they served their customers. 'This is too sweet, this is too fried...' They wanted something like they'd have in their home country, so at night they'd make us Cantonese food like they'd have in Southern China.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's very funny... there's a secret non-written menu... if you talk to my dad and somehow gain access to the kitchen and are like: "I want this..." It's usually for our Chinese customers, they'll be like: "I want this," and my dad will be like: "Tight, cool."
        </p>

        <p>
          When we think of authenticity, I think - if I asked my friend Isabella, who is Filipina, 'what did you eat when you grew up? What did your immigrant mom make for you? What do you have the best memories of eating?' that's what we want to find when we go out to eat. What taps into these homeland country experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HEAVY TABLE:</b> Do you think COVID-19 is the main driver of racism here in Minnesota, or did it just expose something ugly that was always here?
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HOONG:</b> I think Minnesota has always been racist. I think Coronavirus brought in a new way for people to express it. My parents would be accused of having COVID-19 because they're Chinese. Or people would ask them, 'Oh, is there virus in our food that you just gave us?' There are different ways people can express racism. When I was growing up, people would be like: 'Oh, did you put dog in this food?' There were a lot of hurtful things that have been said to me and my family. We had COVID-19 inspire a lot of hate crimes against our Asian community, and it's really sad to see that.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>LOR:</b> I believe it's always been there as well. I grew up in St. Paul and I personally didn't experience all of that because I went to a predominantly Hmong high school. Growing up and going to Carleton college, and working in corporate American I definitely do experience that.
        </p>

        <p>
          My parents have been afraid to go out on their daily walks because they'll hear about these reports of elderly Asian people being beaten up just for being outside, so that's been really hard to deal with.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HEAVY TABLE:</b> What's been your favorite discovery on your culinary journey?
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>LOR:</b> Our favorite restaurant we've been to so far is Manila Sizzling Wok and Grill up on University Avenue. They have - the thing about their menu is that they post a different menu every day, but whatever you eat, it's delicious.
        </p>

        <p>
          We went on a day when they had pork belly in a curry sauce... Rowan [Gutierrez], the owner, will give you samples of every dish that you want to try. It's all delicious. I think that their restaurant is fantastic.
        </p>

        <p>
          He really took the time to educate us about what he put in the dishes and how they're different. Any dish from Manila Sizzling Wok is delicious.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>HOONG:</b> Every single bite you take from the food from that restaurant seems to evoke every single flavor. That's the place I would recommend going to.
